# RNN-BIQA
## Blind image quality model using RNN for spatial pooling

We propose an image quality model attempting to mimic the attention mechanism of human visual system (HVS) by using a recurrent neural network (RNN) for spatial pooling of the features extracted from different spatial areas (patches) by a deep CNN-based feature extractor. This package contains the essential Matlab scripts for implementing the proposed image quality assessment method.
